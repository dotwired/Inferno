## The idea

WordPress [Theme Frameworks](http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Frameworks), as well as they're written and as awesome as they work, are always doing too much for the user, require You to deal with them too long or do not provide enough features. In fact, there has been no perfect theme framework (until now, hehe), so most theme authors are even more motivated to make the huge effort to write an own framework than to use the available ones.

That's where Inferno joins in. Inferno provides a wide amount of pre built features with consistent syntax, yet it's up to You whether You want to use these features or not. Basically, Inferno will extend the script library of Your WordPress with commonly used scripts like `jquery-superfish` or `modernizr`. That's it. *If* You want more, just activate a highly customizable and advanced Options Panel. Or the Shortcode Generator. Or a custom Meta Box. And best (apart from the fact that Inferno is completely free) about this is that all three modules use the same Options Machine (that's how I call the Engine behind the form generator), so the syntax for creating option fields in the Options Panel, the Shortcode Generator and the Meta Box are almost identically.
