WordPress Inferno Framework.
===

Inferno is right on its way to become the best WordPress Theme Framework ever. Just drop it in Your Theme directory, include inferno.php and run it with `<?php new Inferno(); ?>`. Optionally pass a configuration array to the initialization. To use the built in Options Framework, drop a settings.php with an intuitive settings array (check out the example) into Your theme directory and the Option Panel will magically appear.


Features
---

- Easy and absolutely feature rich, providing the following option types in the Options Framework: `text`, `textarea`, `select`, `radio`, `radio-image`, `font`, `range`, `spinner`, `image`, `colorpicker`
- Provides minimal and extendable (but already stylish) styles for WordPress native elements and classes (e.g. Gallery, Image Captions, alignment classes, etc.)
- Handle all Your generous Scripts and Styles from one point! Inferno registers a bunch of popular Scripts (e.g. `jquery-easing`, `jquery-tweet` and many more). All You have to do is to enqueue them where needed.
- Superfish is outdated. Much smaller and cleaner solved by a CSS 3 Stylesheet resulting in easy, super fast and beautiful drop down menus!
- Missing something? Open an issue!

Changelog

*v0.9*
- Initial commit. Still very buggy, because fast handed ported, puzzled and stripped out from my Code I'm using for premium Themes.
