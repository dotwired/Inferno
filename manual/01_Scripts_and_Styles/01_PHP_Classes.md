# PHP Classes

In the following some classes are described which I consider very useful for use in theme code at times. It may end up saving you a lot of time.

All PHP classes are really plug and play. Also, it is unlikely to produce any errors even if you have included some of the classes already in your theme or use a plugin which integrates these classes.

### Inferno_Preview

This class generates preview images (with help of the [Aqua Resizer][Aqua Resizer] class) wrapped with cool effects and eventually links.

```php

```
