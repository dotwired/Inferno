# PHP Classes

In the following some classes are described which are considered very useful for use in theme code at times. It may end up saving you a lot of time.
All scripts which come with WP-Inferno are licensed under [MIT license][license_mit] unless stated otherwise.

All PHP scripts are really plug and play. Also, it is unlikely to produce any errors even if you have included some of the classes already in your theme or use a plugin which integrates these classes. See the respective documentation of the scripts.

* [TGM Plugin Activation][TGM Plugin Activation] require and recommend plugins for themes - by Thomas Griffin

## Usage

All PHP classes listed above can be called directly. You don't need to require them any more if Inferno is loaded.


## Acknowledgments

At this point thank you to all script authors who are doing such a great job in providing useful scripts for free to other people and make possible for others to create further great projects and products.
